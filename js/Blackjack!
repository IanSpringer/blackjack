Blackjack!

Your aim is simple. Get as close to 21 without going over, or'busting'. You and the dealer
will each be dealt a two card hand, though only one of the dealer's cards will be revealed to you, while you must reveal both.
Face cards are worth 10 points, Aces are 11, and numeric card values are worth their rank (ex. 2Hearts = 2pts.) After the hands are dealt,
it is your move to make.
There are two plays at your dispoal. You may either 'Stand' if you feel as though you are close enough to 21, or 'Hit' if you think your two card total is too low.
If you are feeling lucky, you may wager more by hitting the 'Bet' button before you 'Hit' or 'Stand'.

The best hand you can be dealt is an Ace and one of the four face cards on the initial two card hand, known as 'BlackJack' (or 21). This is an automaic win for you and
is paid out at 3/2. Shoule you go over on your hit, you will lose, though you may hit as many times as you like until you hit 21 or 'bust'.

If you haven't busted and feel you're close enough to 21, you may 'Stand', which will give the dealer his chance to move. The dealer will reveal his hidden card and must hit
until his combine total is at least equal to 17. From here, whoever has the higher score without going over, wins.
